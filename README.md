## Node JS - OTRS Integration

	This is an ongoing project that works with the OTRS Ticketing System API.

	In order to use it, you must change the information present in "ticket_search.json" file and create a .env file following the pattern of the .env.example file.
	
	Futurely, i'm going to implement some new features, like ticket create, session create and other Webservice methods.
